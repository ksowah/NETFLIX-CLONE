I used React YouTube to get movie trailers from YouTube. This dependency requires a URL id so I used Movie Trailer, which provides the id needed to pull the trailer from YouTube based on the name of the Movie. The search is not well optimized so it occasionally provides wrong or no trailer for a movie. I'm still looking for a better tool.
